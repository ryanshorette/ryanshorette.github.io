     <h1> Ryan's experiences at UMaine! </h1>
     <h2> Freshmen year </h2>
     	<p> Ryan has been having a great first semester thus far! His semester has consisted of doing his homework for all his classes to maintain a high GPA *4.0 as of right now*, trying out Ultimate Frisbee Club, joining the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and doing plenty of intramurals!
     		<h3> Ryan's intramurals! </h3>
     		<UL>

				    <LI>B Soccer</LI>
				    <LI>A Ultimate Frisbee</LI>

				<p> Ryan has enjoyed all of the intramurals, some came with success, some did not. Ryan's team won the B bracket in Ultimate Frisbee, and came in second in B bracket in Flag Football.
